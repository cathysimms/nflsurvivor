The rules are simple. Pick one NFL team each week to win their game, and survive to play another week. 3 incorrect picks will eliminate you from the competition, so choose wisely.

## App Design

I have chosen to create an application for an NFL Survivor Pool

Users log into application and each week of the NFL season they pick a team that they think will win their matchup that week.
They start with 3 lives.
If they lose, they lose a life and when they run out of lives they cannot make any more picks
They can only pick a team once per season

You can cange your weekly picks up until the start of the first game for that week. 

Optional - they can join leagues and look at the leaderboard for that league and also look at past and present picks for other users in that league ( but not their future picks )
