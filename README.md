<b>NFL Survivor Pool Application</b>

User logs into application and each week of the NFL season they pick a team that they think will win their matchup that week.
the start with 3 lives
if they lose, they lose a life and when they run out of lives they cannot make any more picks
they can only pick a team once per season

Optional - they can join leagues and look at the leaderboard for that league and also look at past and present picks for other users in that league ( but not their future picks )
